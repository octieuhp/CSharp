Crate an application the will allow a loan amount, interest rate, and number of finance years to be entered for a given loan.
Determine the monthly payment amount. Calculate how much interest will be paid over the life of the loan. Display an amortization 
schedule showing the new balance after each payment is made. 

Design an object-oriented solution. Use two classes. For the Loan class, characteristics such as amount to be financed, rate of 
interest, period of time for the loan, and total interest paid will identify the current state of a loan object. Include methods 
to determine the monthly payment amount, return the total interest paid over the life of the loan, and return an amortization 
schedule.

In the second class, instantiate an object of the loan class. Allow the user to input data about more than one loan. Display in 
the LoanApp class the payment amount, amortization schedule, and the total amount of interest to be paid.
