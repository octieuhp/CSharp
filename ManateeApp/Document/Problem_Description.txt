Create an application that will be used to monitor the number of manatees in a given waterway. A team of researcher files from 
four to six times per month over a regional waterway and log sightings of manatees. The waterway is mapped into diffrenent viewing 
locations. The researchers record the date, location, and a count of the number present at that location.

Determine which day had the highest sightings at a given location. Print that date with the actual name of the month. Also include
the count associated with the highest sighting. Plan your application so that the average number of sightings for a given location 
can be determined.

Design an object-oriented solution. Use two classes. For the manatee sighting class, characteristics such as location, date of 
viewing, and count of manatees should be included. Methods to determine the average, date with the highest number of sightings, 
and associated month name should be part of the class.
